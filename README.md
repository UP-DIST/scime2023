## Venue

The location of Rimske Toplice is surrounded by forested mountains, providing shelter against wind
and supporting rich vegetation. The name _Rimske Toplice_ literally means _Roman hot springs_.
The healing effects of thermal water were already known to the ancient Romans, who built here pools with
hot and cold water already in in 39 BC.
Nowadays, Rimske Terme provides enjoyable calming nature, where people can focus health and well-being, 
and relax. Thermal water, which has a healing effect on the body, helps with this.
